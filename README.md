# Airlines-Delay--Prediction
# Project Overview:
## In this project, we try to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure. 
## Airlines dataset has 539383 instances and 8 different features. 
## Data Cleaning is done, Exploratory Data Analysis is also done and distribution of features is also shown
## Three Classification Algorithms - Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost Classifier are used to model the data
## Out of the 3 Classification models, XGBoost Classifier gives better AU-ROC score of 0.72, hence this model is the best
